          world. The commonly known architecture entrance exam papers include
          NATA, JEE-MAINs, UCEED, NIFT, NID, and AAT. The entrance exam papers

          years. NATA and JEE-MAINs, JEEAdvanced are considered critical

          we analyze and tend to improve every student&apos;s personal learning

          OUR TEACHING METHODOLOGY AND PERSONAL NATA TRAINING
        </Typography>
        <br />
        <Typography variant="caption" component="p">
          To understand our teaching methodology, we need to understand NATA
          more. The National Aptitude Test in Architecture (NATA) is conducted
          by the National Institute of Advanced Studies in Architecture. NATA is
          a national-level architecture entrance examination for studying
          B.Arch. The&quot; test checks the eligibility in the students&apos;
          aptitude in drawing and observation skills, sense of proportion,
          aesthetic sensitivity, and critical thinking.
          <br />
          <br />
          We at Neram believe students must not stick to the traditional
          educational system. Architecture, or any other designing course, is
          not meant to be taught in such ways. We believe teaching cannot be a
          one-size-fits-all thing, and education is supposed to cater to and
          acknowledge students&apos; differences and abilities. Personalized
          learning is the foundation of our unique programs for students. Our
          tutors create interactive two-way sessions for students to feel to be
          a part of. In this manner, we tend to make every student a part of the
          class, express themselves, and eventually build their passion. We like
          to accept that errors, corrections, slow learning, mistakes are all a
          part of the learning process and only meant to be corrected and
          improvised. Motivating them to achieve their perfection is our motto.

          In India, education systems have been offline based for a very long
          time; most students have to move to places to get access to good
          education. Very few companies like BYJU&apos;s, Vedantu are trying to
          break the stereotype and make education within reach to all. Neram is
          one such online coaching center
          <br />
          <br />
          Online coaching in Architecture has helped in breaking many
