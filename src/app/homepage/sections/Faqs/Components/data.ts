    question: "Which Exam should I learn to become Architect?",
    answer:
      "For pursuing architecture course in India, you must have qualified in NATA ( National Aptitude Test for Architecture ). All colleges which act under state government accept NATA score as eligibility for getting admission in state government college. For colleges which come under the Central government of India, like NITs and IITs, JEE Paper 2 Exam will be conducted. IITs & NITs will not take students based on NATA score since NATA is conducted by council of Architecture in India while JEE Mains Exam is conducted by MHRD - India ( Ministry of Human resource and development )",
